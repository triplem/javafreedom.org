= Blog

The first and initial version of this blog was exported from a wordpres instance and then published to the uberspace.de hoster via jbake on the 25th Feb 2022.

== Deployment

To enable automatic publishing to uberspace, I generated a new ssh-key and copied the public key to my shared hoster. The private key is then used on github, to be able
to use the github actions for the deployment. The key should be without a passphrase ;-)

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
> ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -f ssh_publish -C <SOME-KEY-ID>
> ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/ssh_publish.pub <SOME-USER@SOME-SERVER>
#+END_SRC
