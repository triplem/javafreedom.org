Today the biggest computer fair in the world CeBIT in Hannover, Germany started. Does anybody know what CeBIT meant? It is really a shortcut for "Centrum fÃ¼r BÃ¼ro und Informationstechnik". Ah, Apache will be there on Saturday and Sunday as well. So if you would like to meet some of the Apache Developers and Community-Members, come to the OpenBooth of the LinuxPark (Hall 6, B52/C52). Another thing happend today/yesterday is that Struts is now a top level project at apache. Congrats from me ðŸ™‚
