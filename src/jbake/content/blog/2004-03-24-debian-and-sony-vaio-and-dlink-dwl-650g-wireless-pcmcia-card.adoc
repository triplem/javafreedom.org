To use this real nice card (it uses an Atheros chipset) you should download the madwifi driver from sourceforge (http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/madwifi[MadWifi]) You should compile a new kernel and also this driver and then you can use this driver. At the moment I still have to load the driver manually, and also link the driver to the network with ifconfig. But I think that this can be done automatically as well.
