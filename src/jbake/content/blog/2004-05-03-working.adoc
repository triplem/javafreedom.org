Well, today I have had to drive to Kassel for a training of my company. During the ride (i took the train) I enjoyed the silence and read a couple of computer magazines. why is not every day like today? reading magazines and some internet pages and get paid for this? actually some time in my job (and I believe in everybodies work life) is exactly about this. getting more knowledge. as long as you are reading some magazines, relevant to your work, i guess this is totally okay, isn't it? anyway, tomorrow is going to be a busy day, I have to get some things done, which should be finished by thursday. chizzz….
