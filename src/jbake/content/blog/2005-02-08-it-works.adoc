Hello, yesterday I reported that my eMac produces power outages. This was, as I figured out today, totally wrong. It was not the Mac, but the tv cable. When I disconnect the tv cable from the television and the radio cable from the receiver, I can connect from the eMac to the hifi. Thank god, it worksâ€¦.
