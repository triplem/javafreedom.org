Hello, we are programming our application using JBoss, and now I got the task to transfer the application to BEA. I have a couple of problems, since we are using JAAS on the client side and no code on the JBoss side, it gets a little difficult.

First, we are using a custom ClientLoginModule. This is due to the fact, that we have a different Principal üôÅ This ClientLoginModule uses the SecurityAsosciation to transfer this principal to the server. I use the Weblogic Environment class, but this class does not allow a non-string principal. What to do? I thought about serializing the principal???
