Through the blog of http://jroller.com/page/lsd[LSD] I found a pretty nice multi protocol IM for Mac OS X called http://www.adiumx.com/[Adium]. Up until now I was using http://fire.sourceforge.net/[Fire], which is a pretty neat tool for this. I really like the LnF of Adium and I have already set up all my accounts in this tool. Lets see where this is going to lead us ðŸ™‚

Oh yeah, I did not told you, that LSD is back in the blogosphere ðŸ™‚
