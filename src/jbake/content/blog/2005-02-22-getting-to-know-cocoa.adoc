Well, after some long hours in front of my Mac I got to know Objective-C and Cocoa a little better. I am still in the beginning of this for me "new" language (objective-c) and the framework (Cocoa). I build my first real world window using the Interface Builder delivered by Apple with the XCode toolset.

I browsed quite a couple of websites to the topic and will list some of them here, so that others can also participate on my experiences:

* http://www.cocoabuilder.com/archive/bydate[Cocoabuilder], a pretty nice source for information around Cocoa
* http://cocoadevcentral.com/[CocoaDevCenter], the place to look at, if you are a Cocoa starter like myself
* http://www.macdevcenter.com/[MacDevCenter] O'Reillys site for Mac developers, pretty slick
* http://www.omnigroup.com/developer/sourcecode/[OmniGroup] a page from OmniGroup, where they are publishing there frameworks, used in there applications
* http://developer.snowmintcs.com/frameworks/sm2dgraphview/[SM2DGraphicsFramework], a nice framework for publishing two dimensional graphics in your application.

These links provide some good view into the scene and if you need more, you can always use our friend http://www.google.com/[Google].
