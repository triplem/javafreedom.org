Since I am a diabetic myself, which I told you earlier, I am somewhat interested in this topic. Today I found a website (sorry guys, it is in german), which tells the user, that Halle Berry is diabetic. Also there is an article about Steve Jobs which states, that he probably has diabetic as well, because of his pancreas cancer. Well, I think I am in pretty good companionship.

Also on http://www.diabetes-world.net/55528/lebenssituationen/prominente[this] page you will find lots of other VIPs which do have diabetes. It does not really make me feel better, but at least, I do not feel alone in this world ðŸ™‚ (Well, I know a couple of other diabetics in real world as well, anyway).
