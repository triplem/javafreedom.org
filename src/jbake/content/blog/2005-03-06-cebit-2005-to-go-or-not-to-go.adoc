Anybody going to CeBit? Right now, I am not really sure, if I should go there this year. Last year was pretty nice, since I was on the Apache booth. This year, there is no such booth and there are not really any new technologies out there, which are attractive to me. And since Apple is not there as wellâ€¦
If anybody would like to meet me there, well, just drop a line, and I am going to think this over, but up until now, I believe, I stay home and chill in front of my eMac ðŸ™‚
