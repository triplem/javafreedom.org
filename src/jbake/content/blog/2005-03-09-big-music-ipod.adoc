Today, while waiting for my train to come, I stood in front of a very nice poster from the German Youth Philharmonic Orchestra (is this an english word???). Anyway, this poster can be found at http://jdph.de/pix_image/image9s.jpg[JDPH.de] and shows a face of a man and has the following text (translated) on it: "Suddenly there is music, which is so huge, that it does not fit on any iPod". I think this is a pretty nice advertisement for the philarmonic orchestra. A bigger version of this poster can be found at the home page on the bottom of the guys ðŸ™‚
