Today I found a nice homepage of a company (http://www.colorwarepc.com/[Colorware PC]), doing colorful replacements for iPods and other Mac stuff. I believe, that they just use the original cover and color it using quite some unique colors. Very very nice. Hope, that I am able to order something like this also here in germany ðŸ™‚ I found this link via http://www.schrankmonster.de/[Schrankmonster.de]. They guy writing this blog, used to write this in german, but now he tries to do it in english, so be patient and look often on this site. I find it pretty interesting.
