The configuration I took was pretty much the same like the one, which can be found http://www.ip-phone-forum.de/forum/viewtopic.php?t=1158[here].

The proxy is strict outbound and you have to click "register with proxy". Then I have had to configure the Stun to stun.sipgate.net on the port 10000. I just tested it with the call of the testnumber sipgate provides and it runs
