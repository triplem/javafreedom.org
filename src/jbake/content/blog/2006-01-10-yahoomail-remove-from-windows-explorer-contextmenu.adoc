In the company I work for, we are using Yahoo Messenger. Yesterday I installed my new Computer (it is the old one, just with a new Windoze install) and also installed Yahoo Messenger on it. Then a new Extension in the ContextMenu of Windows Explorer (E-Mail with Yahoo!) appeared. This was pretty annoying, since I never ever use this. Therefor I deleted the registry key:

----
HKEY\_CLASSES\_ROOT\*\shellex\ContextMenuHandlers\Yahoo Mail
----

This deleted the ContextMenu Entry
