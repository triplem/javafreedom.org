Today I found http://easyubuntu.freecontrib.org/[EasyUbuntu]. Pretty nice, I think, so I don't have to install SUNs jdk and other stuff on my own any more ðŸ™‚ There is also http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=66563[Automatix], which is pretty nice also. Since I am already using Dapper, I guess I have to wait a little to use these tools on my machine. +
Also today I installed the new ubuntu server (a daily snapshot). Well, what should I say, it is a server distribution and everything works, like I knew it would, since I have had debian installed on this machine.
