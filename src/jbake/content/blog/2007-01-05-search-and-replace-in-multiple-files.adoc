Today I learned how to search and replace in multiple files. It is pretty easy. You can lookup how it works on the page for http://www.debian-administration.org/articles/298[Debian Administrators]. Basically you have to use a perl single line command like:

----
perl -pi -e 's/about news\.$/about selling advertising space\./' file*
----

This will edit each file directly on its place and will search for the string `about news.` and will replace it with `about selling advertising space`. You are done ðŸ™‚
