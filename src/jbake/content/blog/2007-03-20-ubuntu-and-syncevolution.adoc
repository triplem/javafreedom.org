I just tried to compile http://www.estamos.de/projects/SyncML/[SyncEvolution] with Ubuntu Feisty Fawn. To do this, there are a couple of required packages.

I have installed the following packages:

* libedata-cal1.2-dev
* libedata-book1.2-dev
* libebook1.2-dev
* libedataserver1.2-dev
* libecal1.2-dev
* evolution-data-server-dev

This did the trick on my machine. Obviously I already installed the build-essentials and other stuff for the building of packages.
