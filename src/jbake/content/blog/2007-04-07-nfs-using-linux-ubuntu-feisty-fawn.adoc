Hello,

I just upgraded (basically I installed totally from scratch) my machine to Ubuntu Feisty Fawn. I am working at home with NFS all the time. The process of mounting was pretty slow after the upgrade. Therefor I read a couple of articles on the web and figured, that you have to install portmap on your client machine as well. Now everthing is working.
