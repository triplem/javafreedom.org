I just compiled a new version of http://passwordsafe.sourceforge.net/[PasswordSafeSWT], with a new export feature for GNU Keyring. This works only for GNU Keyring 2.0x at the moment. You can download it right link:/projects/PasswordSafeSWT-0.6-linux.tar.gz[here] for Linux. The sourcecode is already sent to the project, so await more stuff to come soon. The exporter currently works for Password Safe Files Version 1 and 2. The additional stuff for Version 3 files will be added shortly.
