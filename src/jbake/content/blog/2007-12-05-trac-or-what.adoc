I was just out of curiosity browsing for different alternatives for http://trac.edgewall.org[Trac] and found the following alternatives:

* http://www.redmine.org[Redmine] - written in Ruby
* http://collaboa.org/[Collaboa] - Ruby, seems to be not mantained anymore
* http://software.pmade.com/devalot[Devalot]
* http://plone.org/products/poi[Plone POI]

There is no real ranking done by myself. I will report back, when I found out more.
