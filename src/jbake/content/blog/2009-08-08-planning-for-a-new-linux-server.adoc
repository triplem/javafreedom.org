Hello, long time since my last post. Just to give you a short headsup:

Just one thing concerning the last post (Internet Abzocker). This company just send a so-called "Mahnbescheid" last week and we have no entered a "Widerspruch", so let's see what is going to happen.

Now entering the newes topic. I have a (not anymore running) Linux Server at home. This is an old Pentium 3 dual processor with 800MHz and round about 500GB of hard disc space splitted onto 4 discs. This monster is quite lound, and that is the reason I do not let it run 24/7 anymore. Now I am planning to buy a new server. This new machine is going to be a "hand made" server and not a complete machine. 

My current budget is around 500â‚¬ (probably a little above), and I the following requirements:

* Dual Core
* 64bit
* 4GB Ram
* 2-4TB HDD
* SATA-II
* eSATA
* ATX-Formfactor / Midi-Tower
* USB2.0
* Sound
* Silent

The problem of the above configuration is, that I did not find any recommendations in the Web for a Linux System, where all of the above compontens are supported 100%. Therefor this is going to be a little bit of a game ðŸ™‚

From the software perspective, the OS is going to be a Linux Distribution (most probably Ubuntu Server, but could be Arch as well). I would like to run an Asterisk Server, and most probably the normal SBS-stuff (e.g. Mail, SMB, â€¦). A nice Groupware would be nice as well, and most probably it is going to be http://www.tine20.org/[Tine 2.0]. For me it is quite important that the Groupware syncs with my iPhone.

If you do have any recommendations concerning the above configuration, don't hesitat and contact me, via Twitter or via Mail. I will report on the detailed configuration I came up with and on my experiences with it. The whole system should be up and running by the end of Q3 this year. Currently I am just looking for experiences of others and also for some in-expensive hardware. it is basically a gathering phase, before I am going to spend my bugs ðŸ™‚
