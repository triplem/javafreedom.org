I have now successfully installed Arch Linux on my Thinkpad W500. Sound was a problem. I do have the following Soundcard in the Laptop:

----
[root@athene modprobe.d]# cat /proc/asound/card0/codec#* | grep Codec
Codec: Conexant CX20561 (Hermosa)
Codec: Conexant ID 2c06

----

To get this up and running I edited the file `/etc/modprobe.d/alsa-sound.conf` (keep in mind, that there is probably already a file 50-alsa.conf or something like that, which is can be configured in the described way as well, I just renamed this file) with the following entries:

----
options snd_slots=snd-hda-intel
options snd-hda-intel model=laptop
alias snd-card-0 snd-hda-intel
alias sound-slot-0 snd-hda-intel
----

and added my user to the group audio using the following command: 

----
gpasswd -a USERNAME audio
----

You can then test your audio device with the following command:

----
aplay /usr/share/sounds/alsa/Front_Center.wav
----

The following link (in german) was really useful for me: http://wiki.archlinux.de/title/Alsa

Be aware, that you will find the Soundcard in the following list with the model name Conexant 5051
