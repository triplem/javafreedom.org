To make a nice boot-process, I have had to install http://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Fbsplash[fbsplash]. The install is pretty seemless and easy. To make the whole process really nice, my menu.lst is configured as follows:

----
title  Arch Linux (boot logo)
root   (hd0,0)
kernel /vmlinuz26 root=/dev/disk/by-uuid/577947c2-06ad-4bce-825f-a882228f724d ro quiet console=tty1 vga=795 splash=silent,theme:arch-black,fadein,fadeout
initrd /kernel26.img

----

Note, that I did not write a logo.nologo into the kernel-line, like suggested in the Arch Wiki.

For this, I installed beforehand the themes from the package `fbsplash-theme-arch-black`. To make the whole process more streamlined, I also edited the /etc/conf.d/fbsplash file:

----
SPLASH_STAY_SILENT="yes"
----
