For Arch, I needed an xorg.conf, which basically runs on my W500. The W500 has some specialties, in that it has two discinct graphic cards, one Intel and one AMD. I have found an XOrg on http://my.stargazer.at[Stargazers Blog]. Please find the Xorg.conf directly http://my.stargazer.at/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/xorg.conf[here]. Thanks Stargazer.
