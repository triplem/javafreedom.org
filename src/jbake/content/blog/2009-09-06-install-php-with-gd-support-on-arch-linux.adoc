To install PHP on an Arch Linux Box is pretty straight forward. Most will need MySQL, pretty easy, take a look at: http://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/PHP[ArchLinux Wiki - PHP].

If gd.so is not not working, even after uncommenting the line extension=gd.so in php.ini:

Use `ldd /usr/lib/php/2006.../gd.so` and find that some libs are missing, explicitly freetype2 and libpng. Probably even libjpeg. 

After installing those, everything should work fine ðŸ™‚

Now all is working.
