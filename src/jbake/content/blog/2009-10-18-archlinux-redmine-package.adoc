Yesterday I have published my first package (redmine-mysql-svn) into the AUR (ArchLinux User Repository). This package installs my favourite Project Management System (guess which one?, Redmine of course) using an existing MySQL DB onto ArchLinux. I hope that you will find it useful.

This package is based on the work of http://scm.narf.ssji.net/archlinux-packages/browser/redmine[Ssji].
