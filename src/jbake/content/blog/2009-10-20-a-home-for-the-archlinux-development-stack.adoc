The ArchLinux Development Stack found a Home. I received some very friendly, personel and quick support from the guys at http://openpario.net[Open+Pario] and that was the main reason I chose this one. They are hosting a http://www.redmine.org[Redmine] instance and http://www.git-scm.org[GIT], so this is a perfect fit for the stack. 

Please browse to http://openpario.mime.oregonstate.edu:3000/projects/archdevstack to get an impression of the project. 

Like already stated, any help is welcome, so register yourself and provide feedback, suggestions and everything else you can think of.
