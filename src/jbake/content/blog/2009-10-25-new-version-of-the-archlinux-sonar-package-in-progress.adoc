I started with a new version of the http://sonar.codehaus.org[Sonar] package for ArchLinux. The major improvement will be the separation of configuration files into /etc/sonar and log files into /var/log/sonar. This separation is done via some hard coding of pathes in the sonar.sh and the wrapper.conf. 

If you are interested in this package, this improvement will be put into the http://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?ID=31321[AUR] soon. 

I hope that these changes can be used also for the Nexus package, which will be put into the AUR soon as well. 

If you are interested in one of these packages, please contact me.
