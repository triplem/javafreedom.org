After I opened a file in gedit (under Gnome), and edited the file, this file contains now a lot of ^M-tags on the end of each line.

To remove these tags (using vi), I found http://www.tech-recipes.com/rx/150/remove-m-characters-at-end-of-lines-in-vi/[this] page, where a standard syntax for this kind of search and replace of special characters is explained.

This command is kind of tricky in that you have to type the Ctrl-V and Ctrl-M in sequence to receive the right command.
