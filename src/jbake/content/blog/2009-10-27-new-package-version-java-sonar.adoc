I have now finally published the newest version of the ArchLinux DevStack package Sonar. This contains now some major improvements in the Linux-ification. Meaning that now all configuration files are stored in /etc/sonar and the PID file is stored in /var/run. The logs are also stored in /var/log/sonar.

I hope, that this will help you in using this package. The next version of the package will include an own user for Sonar.

This new package can also be found in the http://repo.or.cz/w/archlinuxdevstack.git[GIT-Repository] as well as in the http://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?ID=31321[AUR]. For new Features and Bugs, please visit the http://openpario.mime.oregonstate.edu:3000/projects/archdevstack[Project Homepage].

All Help is welcome and appreciated.
