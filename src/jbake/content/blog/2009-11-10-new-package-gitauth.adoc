Today I publishe a new package (http://github.com/brownbeagle/gitauth[gitauth]) to the http://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?ID=31907[AUR]. I have already written some lines about gitauth. Mainly it is a ruby written replacement for Gitosis. This will be in the future a major part of the ArchLinux Developement Stack.
