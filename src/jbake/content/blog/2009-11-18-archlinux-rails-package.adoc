Sine yesterday I am the official Maintainer of the ArchLinux Rails package, which can still be found in the http://aur.archlinux.org[AUR]. I take over from Grumpytoad, who offered to Mentor me on the next release. So Raider is now known as Twix, everything else stays the same ðŸ™‚

I put the sources in the same Git Repository as the ArchLinux DevStack.

So, if you want to help out, you are more then welcome.
