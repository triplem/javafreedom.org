Today, I released the latest version (0.3) of the ArchLinux Development Stack. This version contains a lot of changes to nearly all packages. Most of the packages got renamed and also cleaned up. Another interesting addition to the stack is the http://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?ID=14624[Rails] package. On this page, I added the Ruby on Rails https://rails.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8994/tickets/3144/[1.9 friendly secure compare patch], because without it, Redmine is not running correctly under Ruby 1.9.1v243, which is the default under ArchLinux right now.

Thanks for all the help, I received during the updates of the packages. For more information or feedback, please go to the http://openpario.mime.oregonstate.edu:3000/projects/archdevstack[projectpage].
