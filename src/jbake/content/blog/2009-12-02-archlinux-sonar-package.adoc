Yesterday I received a message, that the Sonar Package (an integral part of the http://openpario.net/projects/archlinuxdevstack[ArchLinux Development Stack]) is not working correctly on i686-Architectures. This package is now updated and can be installed from the http://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?ID=32024[AUR].

If you have any Feedback or suggestions, please Report them here, on the Projectpage or directly in the AUR.
