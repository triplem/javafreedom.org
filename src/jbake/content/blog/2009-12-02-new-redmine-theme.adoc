On the http://openpario.net/projects/archlinuxdevstack[ArchLinux DevStack] Projectpage you can find now a new Redmine Theme. I have posted this on the Redmine page as well. This Theme (ArchLinux Redmine Theme) is based on the Design found on the ArchLinux Pages. 

Have fun using this theme. Please Report any feedback and suggestions on the Projectpage or on the http://www.redmine.org[Redmine] page.
