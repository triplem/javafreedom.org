A close relative bought a JP-S3 from Samsung. This is a so called MTP-Device. I do not have any Device with an Windows Media Player 10, which is needed to sync the this device. Therefore I browsed through the Internet and finally found http://libmtp.sourceforge.net/[libmtp]. This is a library to sync devices through the Media Transfer protocol (a M$ specific protocol, I believe). 

I have had a couple of problems with this, until I removed the usb_storeage Module from the module list as well as the ehci_hcd module. After I did this, the command `mtp-detect` gives me a lot of information, after before the command just gave me, that the resource is busy.

The following commands are needed for the whole sync:

----
rmmod ehci_hcd
rmmod usb_storage (really important)</p>
<p>mtp-detect

----

If you are really brave, you can sync your tracks, using 

----
mtp-sendtr -t TRACKNAME -a AUTHOR -g GENRE -n TRACKNO -l CD-TITLE SOURCEFILE FOLDERNO_ON_DEVICE

----

so e.g. 

----
mtp-sendtr sendtr -t "Burning Fire" -a "James Kelly" -g "Pop" -n 1 -l "Babylon" -y 2006 -b "Babylon" -/media/cd/001\ Burning\ Fire.mp3 32775

----

The number 32775 is the code for the folder and can be found out with 

----
mtp-folders
----

The application will ask for needed additional information.

Fortunately now I could call the gnomad2 tool and sync the stuff. The banshee-stuff did not work and just gave me the information, that the Resource is busy üôÅ
