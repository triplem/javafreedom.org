Today the Archserver.org project released the "new" LTS kernel of the 2.6.32 series. The kernel as well as the whole core (e.g. binutils, gcc, etc) are already uploaded for x86_64. The i686 packages will be updated soon as well.

ArchServer is making good progress, and we have now released the first version of VirtualBox Images.
