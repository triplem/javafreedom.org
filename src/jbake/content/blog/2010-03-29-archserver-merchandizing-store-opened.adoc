Hello,

we have now our own Merchandizing (or lets call it Schwag like the guys from http://www.archlinux.org[Arch Linux]) online. Please take a look on http://www.zazzle.com/archserver?rf=238742509226063771[zazzle.com]. 

Right now there is just one product online, but there are more to come ðŸ˜‰

So, if you have suggestions or remarks, post them in our http://bbs.archserver.org[Forum] or write me an email.
