I am using the public ZNC (an IRC bouncer) from http://gshellz.org/gsh/Public_ZNC_HOWTO[globalshellz.org] for my access to the freenode IRC network. I have had a minor problem when I connected to my ZNC. Since my away nick was not registered to my account (which is triplem btw), I have had to "login" each time when I connected to the ZNC and my nick was changed from triplem[a] to triplem. So, I started my IRC client (XChat btw) and forgot to type in my password again, this lead to a problem that my nick was temporarily unavailable. To resolve this I looked on the http://freenode.net/faq.shtml#nicksetup[freenode page] and found the following easy solution:

. Registered my away nick with /nick triplem[a] and /msg nickserv group (of course I needed to login to my account, which was not a problem, since several nicks are already grouped to my main nick and I just chose one of those).
. I released the original nick (triplem) with the following command: /msg nickserv release triplem <password>, and everything was fine.

Hope this helps you as well. And if you would like to meet me on IRC, you can take a look into the following channels:

* shellium
* globalshellz
* netburst
* archserver

Probably we meet us there ðŸ˜‰
