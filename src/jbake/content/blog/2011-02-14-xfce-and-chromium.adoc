I recently switched (once again) from gnome to another Desktop Environment. This time I have chosen Xfce. To make chromium open thunar for folders, I have had to follow the following post in the https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=112192[ArchLinux Forum]. Basically it is a minor change in the xdg-open file, which will most probably be break as soon as there is an update to this one, or they are updating this one for the latest Xfce incarnation.

Hope this helps you as much as it helped me.
