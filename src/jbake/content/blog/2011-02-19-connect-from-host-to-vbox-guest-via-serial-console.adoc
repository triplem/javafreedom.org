Today I need to connect to the serial console of a VBox instance to test the serial console boot and connection of the guest system (ArchServer that is). There seem to be a lot of ways on how to do this, I am just explaining, what works for me, using Arch Linux as the Host:

----
socat UNIX-CONNECT:/home/triplem/com1 TCP-LISTEN:8040
telnet localhost 8040
----

This was not working, in that I always received strange Characters in my terminal as soon as I used e.g. the cursor keys. This did not work, even after changing the terminal emulation to VT100 and all others.

The same is true for socat unix-client:/home/triplem/com1 stdout.

I do not seem to be able to work with this kind of stuff, the following tip was not working as well: +
