During the last weekend, I moved my domains (javafreedom.org and wifi-frankfurt.de) to the uberspace.de location. Because of this, it can happen, that emails where not delivered or bounced.

The movement was quite fast (something like 24 hours) for all things. The guys at uberspace.de were really really nice and helped a lot. I can only recommend to any geek out there, to move her domains to uberspace.de.
