Hello,

for my current vacation (my wife is going to look Olympic Games via TV the whole time) I decided to do me a favor and bought a TonidoPlug2. Since I am pretty much into ArchLinux, I decided to put ArchLinux on this device as well (see http://archlinuxarm.org/platforms/armv5/tonidoplug-2[ArchLinux ARM]). I used the Installation description on the above site without any problems, the way I did it, it went quite smooth. The difference was, that I did install the whole distribution on an USB-Stick before the device even arrived using my ArchLinux Laptop. Very nice ðŸ˜‰

Now I am in the process of finish the Installation on the device (following some advice from http://binarybitme.blogspot.de/2012/07/arch-linux-arm-post-install-notes.html[binarybitme] and this went pretty smooth as well. The tipp with the haveged is pretty useful for the current upgrade of pacman, which requires some entropy for the `pacman-key --init` command.

Furthermore I decided to use WLAN on this device (hey, thats why I decided to buy this one). Therefor I found one interesting http://archlinuxarm.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=20&t=1659&start=60#p16315[forum entry] which helped a lot ðŸ˜‰ In the current version of Arch Linux, the firmware is beneath /usr/lib and not under /lib, like described in the post. Then I installed netcfg and configured /etc/rc.conf and /etc/network.d/w-int-static (wireless device) as well as the /etc/conf.d/netcfg (without this one, netcfg can work, as long as rc.conf is configured correctly). For the whole wlan stuff to work (depending on your used security key) I had to install wpa_supplicant.

rc.conf:

# wlan configs fail)

I am not going to show my wpa_supplicant-settings, but these were fairly easy and could already be tested on the laptop.
