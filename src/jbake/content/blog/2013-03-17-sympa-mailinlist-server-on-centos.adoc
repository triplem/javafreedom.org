To install Sympa on a CentOS 6.4 machine is not as easy as one would expect. I found http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.mail.sympa.user/1255[this] entry in one of the mailing lists, and I have to admit, it works like a charm ðŸ˜‰

So, here once again, for reference:

----
cd /etc/yum.repos.d
wget http://sympa-ja.org/download/rhel/6/sympa-ja.org.rhel6.repo
cd /var/tmp
wget http://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/6/x86_64/epel-release-6-8.noarch.rpm
rpm -i epel-release-6-8.noarch.rpm
yum install sympa-httpd
Review /usr/share/doc/sympa-6.1.17/README.RPM-install

----

After this, I needed to install a RDBMS, and since I do prefer http://www.postgresql.org/[PostgreSQL] I installed it (using the tutorial from http://www.if-not-true-then-false.com/2010/howto-install-postgresql-8-4-database-server-on-centos-fedora-red-hat/[here]) via:

----
yum install postgresql postgresql-server postgresql-contrib postgresql-devel 
# Initialize database directory
service postgresql init
# Start service
service postgresql start
# create sympa db
su postgres
>createdb sympa
>psql sympa
>>CREATE ROLE sympa WITH SUPERUSER LOGIN PASSWORD 'sympa';
>>\q
>exit

----

Furthermore, I adopted the file pg_hba.conf:

----
#host all all 127.0.0.1/32 ident
host all all 127.0.0.1/32 md5
#host all all ::1/128 ident
host all all ::1/128 md5

----

To check, if the connection is working, try: 

----
psql -h localhost -U sympa sympa

----

Also the perl package DBI:Pg is needed for the connection of sympa to postgres.

----
yum install perl-DBD-Pg

----

After all these preparations, we are going to install sympa.

----
sympa_wizard.pl

----

Note, that it is possible to change the made settings in the /etc/sympa/sympa.conf file. Since we are using PostgreSQL we do have to adopt the setting db_port in this file to 5432.

To create the DB correctly (basically, the DB is already created above), I had to comment out the database creation in the file /usr/share/sympa/bin/create_db.Pg:

----
--CREATE DATABASE sympa;

----

Unfortunately the script `sympa.pl --create_db` was not working correctly for Postgresql, and therefor I tried to run the DB creation script manually:

----
psql -h localhost -U sympa sympa
>\i /usr/share/sympa/bin/create_db.Pg
>\q

----

After this, everything seemed to be alright ðŸ˜‰ And another thing, CentOS seems to be pretty restrictive, so please stop iptables or adopt the settings, otherwise it is not possible to connect to the server from the outside.

Not everything is alright here, I needed to change some of the premissions of the fcgi-Scripts in /usr/libexec/sympa as well as the description for the file /etc/sympa/sympa.conf. Furthermore centOs is making heavy use of SELinux, therefor some additional settings need to get applied:

----
setsebool -P httpd_can_sendmail 1
----

Since I am using this only in a virtual box, I disabled SELinux completely, therefor the above statement is not necessary at all anymore.

After all this, sympa is still running in maintenance mode, because of several permission restrictions of sympa (which are fine for productions environments, but for a development environment these are just nasty). Therefor I followed http://www.sympa.org/manual/web-interface[this] guide (specifically: run apache as the user sympa).

Btw, if you wander, why the heck CentOS is now on my list of OSes, this is mainly to work with the same environment like my hoster and on ArchLinux I did have a lot of trouble to install Sympa as well ;-( I am working with Sympa now in a VBox, so that it does not disturb my normal system usage.
