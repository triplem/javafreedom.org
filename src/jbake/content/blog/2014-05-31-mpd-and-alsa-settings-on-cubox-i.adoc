I have had some trouble with some songs playing on my cubox-i via the SPDIF-Toslink connection. I heard crackling noises on those songs. First I thought, that those were due to some mistake done during ripping those from my CDs. But I tested those songs on some other devices and recognized, that it is most probably due to high frequencies or something similar. 

Therefor I digged into the concrete settings of ALSA and MPD to fiddle around with Frequency- and Volume-Settings. In the end it turned out, that the solution is rather easy and I just had to reduce the volume of the cubox-i SPDIF out to 98%. Now all crackling noises are gone and I can enjoy the music via my home stereo system.

Here are the settings of ALSA (/etc/asound.conf):

----
pcm.imxspdif {
    type hw
    card imxspdif
}
pcm.imxhdmisoc {
    type hw
    card imxhdmisoc
}
ctl.imxspdif {
    type hw
    card imxspdif
}
ctl.imxhdmisoc {
    type hw
    card imxhdmisoc
}
----

The above settings are just setting the devices in the Cubox-I to be used by alsa. The "imxspdif" is important, because this one is used by the following MPD-setting:

----
audio_output {
   type   "alsa"
   name "imxspdif"
   mixer_type "software"
}

----

Unfortunately I could not use "alsactl store" to store my alsamixer settings, therefor I have set the mixer_type of MPD to software, which allows to call the 

----
mpd volume -2
----

command inside of my mediaplayer-startup script. This command sets the used volume to 98%. Now everything is working fine, on every boot, like wanted ðŸ˜‰
