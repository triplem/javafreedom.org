Back from vacation I am currently in the process to create an image gallery using http://sigal.saimon.org/[sigal]. 

Unfortunately sigal can only copy EXIF tags to the (smaller) images in the gallery or rotate the images correctly. 

Since this is needed for some of the pictures, I have done, I use http://www.sentex.net/~mwandel/jhead/[jhead].

The following line is quite helpful to rotate jpgs based on the EXIF tags:

`find -name &quot;*.JPG&quot; -exec jhead -autorot {} \;`
