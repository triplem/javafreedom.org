Finally I have made it and ripped the whole CD collection of us. The whole collection can be seen on http://www.discogs.com/user/triplem74/collection[discogs]. I will add new CDs in there, if those are added to the ripped cd. The whole process took more then one and a half year (well, I really starte end of Mai 2013), but I guess, it was worth it.
