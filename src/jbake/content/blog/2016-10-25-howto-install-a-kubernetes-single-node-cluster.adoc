We just published a documentation on how to install a single-node "cluster" at my preferred http://www.netcup.de[Hoster]. This documentation describes, on how to install [coreOS](https://coreos.com/) and initialize the single-node cluster on this node.

This is really helpful for "testing" the DevOpsKube Environment, but could be also used for small projects.

The documentation can be found in the https://github.com/devopskube/devopskube-single-node[github Repository].
