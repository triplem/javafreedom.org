For my Raspberry Pi, I needed to support the rtl8821au driver for my wireless USB device. The following steps worked for me.

This is based on https://edimax.freshdesk.com/support/solutions/articles/14000032146-how-to-install-ew-7811-ac600-series-adapter-on-raspberry-pi[this article]

----
pacman -S make dkms linux-raspberrypi-headers
git clone https://github.com/diederikdehaas/rtl8812AU.git
cd rtl8812AU
change Makefile:
CONFIG_PLATFORM_I386_PC from y to n
CONFIG_PLATFORM_ARM_RPI from n to y
make
make install
reboot

----

To use the driver and the device, several additional steps have to be followed, this is based on https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/7987/wifi-configuration-on-arch-linux-arm[StackExchange].

----
pacman -S netctl dhclient
cd /etc/netctl
install -m640 examples/wireless-wpa wireless-home
Adopt above file to your needs
Add /etc/netctl/hooks/dhcp:
  #!/bin/sh
  DHCPClient='dhclient'
netctl start wireless-home
netctl enable wireless-home
----

After all those steps and another reboot, the wifi-device should work.
