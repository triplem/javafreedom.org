I just published my personal dotfiles to https://github.com/triplem/dotfiles[github]. Of special interest for you could be the Doom Emacs configuration, found https://github.com/triplem/dotfiles/tree/main/dot_doom.d[here]. All personal settings are now externalised using the already existing chezmoi template functionalities and this
information is therefor not to be found in this specific repository.
